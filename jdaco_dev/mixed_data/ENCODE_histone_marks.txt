H3K27ac GO:0043974 /
# tightly associated with inactive promoters, m1 with active -> differentiate
H3K27me3 GO:0098532 /
# serves as a mark for HDAC binding in promoters to define transcription direction, may define exons
#H3K36me3 GO:0097198 /
# me3 defines actively transcribed genes; bivalent with repressive marks like H3K27me3

#H3K79me2 nothing described
# highly correlated with active promoters
